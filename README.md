this is my second part of the project, is the Text Simplification feature, which simplifies complex text into a simpler form, I trained three models on hugging face,
namely t5, bart, and flan-t5, and then I worked finetuned for the three models, then voting_ensemble them, then I calculated the accuracy by SARI

and I leveraged the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to develop the Text Simplification feature, which simplifies complex text into a simpler form.
